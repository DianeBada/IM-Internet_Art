<p>This week's foray into the world of internet art has been quite an adventure. After much contemplation, I decided to shift my approach and come up with a new concept. I began by researching PRAW and how to implement it correctly using Visual Studio Code. To my surprise, I discovered that I didn't even need to install it. I could retrieve images solely by using the fetch function in JavaScript. This led me to my next biggest issue: learning a lot about JavaScript and how to work with functions and create my own functions to bring my concept to life.

  After much brainstorming, I came up with a new concept. I would have an introduction that states what the beauty in student chaos really is, followed by a collage of memes. Each image would be retrieved from the college memes subreddit and placed randomly until a collage is made. My biggest struggle with this task was that some of the posts in this subreddit were not images but words. To ensure that only images were retrieved and not words, I had to make sure that the fetch function only retrieved posts that ended with a .png or .jpeg.
  
  Another issue that I encountered was having the introductory words disappear first and then having the memes appear. I tried playing with the duration of how long texts are displayed, but even so, the last text that reads "Memes" has a meme that appears first before the canvas is erased and then given the space for memes to populate. This is something that I will work on in the next iteration.
  
  A small issue that I have left unaddressed is the last text that's supposed to display after the explosion of the images that says "Thank you for watching." Even though there's a function for that, it does not show at the end. I tried rearranging the function and placing it elsewhere within my script, but it didn't work in the way that it should have. Despite these issues, I feel that I managed to implement this internet art project well. It took the most time, but I really wanted to see my vision come to life.
  
  However, I do worry that I might not have enough time to implement everything else and make my website look overall clean and good. I still need to make final decisions regarding the overall aesthetic of the page and how things will be laid out. It's important to me that I take the time to get this right and ensure that the user experience is enjoyable and easy to navigate.
  
  Overall, this experience has been quite challenging, but also rewarding. I've learned a lot about JavaScript and functions and how to implement APIs correctly. I'm excited to continue working on this project and see it come to fruition.</p>
